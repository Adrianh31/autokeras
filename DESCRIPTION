Description: [Auto-Keras](https://autokeras.com/) is an open source software 
    library for automated  machine learning (AutoML). It is developed by
    [DATA Lab](http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/xiahu/index.html) at Texas A&M
    University and community contributors. The ultimate goal of AutoML is to
    provide easily accessible deep learning tools to domain experts with limited
    data science or machine learning background. Auto-Keras provides functions
    to automatically search for architecture and hyperparameters of deep
    learning models.
